# 🗳️ New Fair Voting System (1 Person = 1 Vote)

## 🎯 **System Overview**

### **Key Features:**
1. ✅ **1 Person = 1 Vote** (NOT token-weighted)
2. ✅ **KYC/AML Verification Required** (only verified investors can vote)
3. ✅ **Proposal Creation Cost** (must pay VGT to create proposal)
4. ✅ **Voting Cost** (must pay VGT to vote)
5. ✅ **Token Locking & Burning/Returning**:
   - If proposal passes (quorum + approval met): Tokens are BURNED 🔥
   - If proposal fails: Tokens are RETURNED 💰

---

## 📋 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Create Proposal**
```
User wants to create proposal
↓
Check: Is user KYC/AML verified? ✅
↓
Check: Does user have enough VGT? (proposalCreationCost)
↓
User pays 1000 VGT → LOCKED in governance contract
↓
Proposal created ✅
```

**Cost:** `proposalCreationCost` (default: 1,000 VGT)

---

### **Step 2: Users Vote**
```
User wants to vote
↓
Check: Is user KYC/AML verified? ✅
↓
Check: Has user already voted? ❌
↓
Check: Does user have enough VGT? (votingCost)
↓
User pays 10 VGT → LOCKED in governance contract
↓
Vote counted as 1 vote (equal weight) ✅
```

**Cost:** `votingCost` (default: 10 VGT per vote)
**Voting Power:** 1 vote per person (regardless of token amount)

---

### **Step 3: Proposal Execution**

Two gates must both pass. There is **no single 51% rule** — thresholds are
configured per proposal type (see the table below) and read from
`proposalThresholds(type)` on chain.

```
Voting period ends
↓
QUORUM:   totalVotes / registeredIdentityCount  ≥  type quorum
          (a share of ELIGIBLE VOTERS, not of votes cast)
          ↳ if not met: executeProposal REVERTS "Quorum not met"
↓
APPROVAL: votesFor / totalVotes  ≥  type approval
↓
If both pass:
  ├─ Execute proposal ✅
  ├─ BURN all locked tokens 🔥
  └─ Status: Executed

If approval not met:
  ├─ Proposal fails ❌
  ├─ RETURN all locked tokens to voters 💰
  └─ Status: Rejected
```

> **Note:** a proposal that fails the *approval* threshold still executes
> successfully — it takes the refund branch. Only a *quorum* failure reverts.
> A UI must therefore keep offering "execute" on failing proposals, or the
> locked VGT can never be reclaimed.

### **Configured thresholds**

| Proposal type | Quorum | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| InvestorTypeConfig | 20% | 60% |
| ComplianceRules | 25% | 65% |
| OracleParameters | 20% | 60% |
| TokenParameters | 30% | 70% |
| SystemParameters | 25% | 65% |
| EmergencyAction | 10% | 75% |
| AddToWhitelist | 15% | 60% |
| RemoveFromWhitelist | 15% | 60% |
| AddToBlacklist | 20% | 70% |
| RemoveFromBlacklist | 20% | 65% |

Set once in `_initializeThresholds()`; there is no setter, so they cannot be
changed after deployment.

## 💰 **Token Economics**

### **Proposal Creation:**
- **Cost:** 1,000 VGT (governance-controlled)
- **Locked:** Yes
- **Returned if fails:** Yes
- **Burned if passes:** Yes

### **Voting:**
- **Cost:** 10 VGT per vote (governance-controlled)
- **Locked:** Yes
- **Returned if fails:** Yes
- **Burned if passes:** Yes

### **Example Scenario:**

```
Proposal Created:
├─ Proposer pays: 1,000 VGT (locked)
└─ Total locked: 1,000 VGT

Voting:
├─ User A votes FOR: pays 10 VGT (locked)
├─ User B votes FOR: pays 10 VGT (locked)
├─ User C votes AGAINST: pays 10 VGT (locked)
├─ User D votes FOR: pays 10 VGT (locked)
└─ Total locked: 1,040 VGT

Result:
├─ Votes: 3 FOR, 1 AGAINST
├─ Percentage: 75% FOR (above this type's approval threshold)
├─ Status: PASSED ✅
└─ Action: BURN 1,040 VGT 🔥

Alternative (Failed):
├─ Votes: 1 FOR, 3 AGAINST
├─ Percentage: 25% FOR (below this type's approval threshold)
├─ Status: FAILED ❌
└─ Action: RETURN 1,040 VGT to all participants 💰
```

## 🔐 **KYC/AML Verification**

### **Requirements:**
- ✅ Must be verified in IdentityRegistry
- ✅ Must have valid KYC claim
- ✅ Must have valid AML claim

### **Checks:**
```solidity
require(identityRegistry.isVerified(msg.sender), "Must be KYC/AML verified");
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents Sybil attacks (one person creating multiple wallets)
- ✅ Ensures compliance with regulations
- ✅ Fair voting (verified identities only)

---

## ⚖️ **Fair Voting (1 Person = 1 Vote)**

### **Old System (Token-Weighted):**
```
User A: 100,000 VGT → 100,000 votes
User B: 1,000 VGT → 1,000 votes
User C: 500 VGT → 500 votes

Total: 101,500 votes
User A has 98.5% voting power! ❌ Unfair!
```

### **New System (Equal Voting):**
```
User A: 100,000 VGT → 1 vote
User B: 1,000 VGT → 1 vote
User C: 500 VGT → 1 vote

Total: 3 votes
Each user has 33.3% voting power! ✅ Fair!
```

---

## 🔥 **Token Burning vs Returning**

### **If Proposal Passes (quorum + approval both met):**
```
Proposal Result: 75% FOR
↓
All locked tokens are BURNED
↓
Proposer: 1,000 VGT → BURNED 🔥
Voter A: 10 VGT → BURNED 🔥
Voter B: 10 VGT → BURNED 🔥
Voter C: 10 VGT → BURNED 🔥
Voter D: 10 VGT → BURNED 🔥
↓
Total burned: 1,040 VGT
Total supply decreased by 1,040 VGT
```

**Why burn?**
- ✅ Reduces total supply
- ✅ Increases scarcity
- ✅ Rewards token holders (deflationary)

---

### **If Proposal Fails (approval threshold not met):**
```
Proposal Result: 25% FOR
↓
All locked tokens are RETURNED
↓
Proposer: 1,000 VGT → RETURNED 💰
Voter A: 10 VGT → RETURNED 💰
Voter B: 10 VGT → RETURNED 💰
Voter C: 10 VGT → RETURNED 💰
Voter D: 10 VGT → RETURNED 💰
↓
Total returned: 1,040 VGT
No tokens burned
```

**Why return?**
- ✅ Fair to voters (didn't waste tokens on failed proposal)
- ✅ Encourages participation
- ✅ No penalty for voting on failed proposals

---

## 🎛️ **Governance-Controlled Costs**

### **Update Proposal Creation Cost:**
```solidity
function setProposalCreationCost(uint256 newCost) external onlyOwner
```

**Example:**
```
Current cost: 1,000 VGT
↓
Governance decides to increase to 5,000 VGT
↓
New proposals now cost 5,000 VGT to create
```

---

### **Update Voting Cost:**
```solidity
function setVotingCost(uint256 newCost) external onlyOwner
```

**Example:**
```
Current cost: 10 VGT per vote
↓
Governance decides to decrease to 5 VGT
↓
New votes now cost 5 VGT each
```

## 📊 **Comparison: Old vs New System**

| Feature | Old System | New System |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Voting Power** | Token-weighted | 1 person = 1 vote |
| **Fairness** | ❌ Whales dominate | ✅ Equal voting |
| **Proposal Cost** | ❌ Free | ✅ Costs VGT |
| **Voting Cost** | ❌ Free | ✅ Costs VGT |
| **Token Locking** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Token Burning** | ❌ No | ✅ If passed |

---

## 🔧 **Contract Changes**

### **VanguardGovernance.sol:**

**New State Variables:**
```solidity
IIdentityRegistry public identityRegistry;
uint256 public proposalCreationCost = 1000 * 10**18; // 1,000 VGT
uint256 public votingCost = 10 * 10**18; // 10 VGT
mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _lockedTokens;
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _voterLockedTokens;
mapping(uint256 => address[]) private _proposalVoters;
```

**Updated Functions:**
- `createProposal()` - Charges creation cost, locks tokens
- `castVote()` - Charges voting cost, locks tokens, 1 vote per person
- `executeProposal()` - Burns tokens if passed, returns if failed

**New Functions:**
- `setProposalCreationCost()` - Update creation cost
- `setVotingCost()` - Update voting cost
- `getLockedTokens()` - View locked tokens
- `getVoterLockedTokens()` - View voter's locked tokens

---

### **GovernanceToken.sol:**

**New Function:**
```solidity
function burn(uint256 amount) external onlyAgent {
    _burn(address(this), amount);
}
```

---

## 🚀 **Testing the New System**

### **Step 1: Deploy**
```bash
npm run demo:interactive:proof

Option 79: Deploy Governance Token (VGT)
→ Deploys with new fair voting system
```

### **Step 2: Distribute Tokens**
```bash
Option 80: Distribute Governance Tokens
→ Users need tokens to pay for proposals/voting
```

### **Step 3: Create Proposal (Costs 1,000 VGT)**
```bash
Option 81: Create Governance Proposal
→ User pays 1,000 VGT (locked)
→ Proposal created
```

### **Step 4: Vote (Costs 10 VGT per vote)**
```bash
Option 82: Vote on Proposal
→ Each user pays 10 VGT (locked)
→ Each user gets 1 vote (equal weight)
```

### **Step 5: Execute**
```bash
Option 83: Execute Governance Proposal
→ If quorum AND approval met: Burn all locked tokens
→ Otherwise: Return all locked tokens
```
