## 🔧 Production Configuration Validation

### Network Settings
```typescript
const PRODUCTION_CONFIG = {
  // Core settings
  deploymentFee: "0.01", // 0.01 ETH
  feeRecipient: "0x...", // Production fee recipient
  
  // Security settings
  recoveryTimelock: 48 * 60 * 60, // 48 hours
  keyRotationTimelock: 24 * 60 * 60, // 24 hours
  maxGasPrice: "100", // 100 gwei maximum
  minConfirmations: 3, // 3 block confirmations
  
  // Performance settings
  gasLimit: 5000000, // 5M gas limit
  batchSize: 10, // Transaction batching
  retryAttempts: 3, // Retry failed transactions
};
```

# Verify all tests pass
echo "✅ All tests must pass before proceeding"
```

### 2. Gas Price Check
```bash
# Check current mainnet gas prices
curl -s "https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=gastracker&action=gasoracle&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY"

# Ensure gas prices are reasonable for deployment
echo "⛽ Current gas price should be < 50 gwei for deployment"
```

### 3. Final Security Review

# Verify deployment
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet FACTORY_ADDRESS "CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS"
```
